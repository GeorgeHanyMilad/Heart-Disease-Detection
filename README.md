# Heart Disease Detection Model

The "Heart Disease Detection Model" is a predictive analytics project designed to identify the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of health metrics and diagnostic test results. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes input data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical information to assess the likelihood of heart disease.

This project is intended for healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and medical researchers, to assist in early detection and diagnosis of heart conditions. It can also be beneficial for health institutions aiming to enhance preventive care, as well as for patients who want to understand their heart health risk factors.
